# Dimensionality Reduction for Windmill Data Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), for analyzing and predicting windmill-generated power. The focus is on reducing feature space while maintaining model performance and improving interpretability.

## Introduction
High-dimensional data often leads to challenges such as increased noise, computational complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction techniques aim to address these issues by transforming the dataset into a reduced feature space while preserving essential information.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains various features related to windmills, such as:
- Wind speed, atmospheric temperature, gearbox temperature, blade angle, and more.
- Target variable: **`windmill_generated_power(kW/h)`** (power generated by the windmill).
- Includes timestamps and categorical variables.

Preprocessing steps:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Extracting time-based features.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - Reduces dimensions by finding components that explain the maximum variance in the data.
   - Key steps: Standardization, covariance matrix computation, eigenvector calculation.

2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**:
   - Maximizes class separability in supervised learning by focusing on features useful for classification.

3. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:
   - Factorizes the data matrix into components to reduce dimensionality.

## Models and Evaluation
A **Random Forest Regressor** is used to predict `windmill_generated_power(kW/h)`. Model performance is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** before and after applying dimensionality reduction.
